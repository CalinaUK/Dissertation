Ethics of Machine Learning

As of 2019, Machine Learning is one of the fastest growing areas in Computer Science. The
knowledge and trends we can extract from data is ever expanding. The amount of data, computational power and techniques available to build models which can predict present today
is unprecedented, but so are the risks. Machine Learning is a field which is not immune to
regulation and ethical standards.

This dissertation looked at publicly available data sets with attributes such as age, gender and
race. Using Machine Learning algorithms and attribute selection, it researched areas of concern
such as discrimination, data misuse and applications of Machine Learning. The experiment used
Machine Learning algorithms to investigate whether further considerations should be taken when
using data with sensitive attributes. This project will attempt to produce desensitised smaller
data sets which can achieve similar accuracy to the full data set. It is important to build models
which do not harm individuals. Additionally a public survey was conducted to find the concerns
the public had with both Machine Learning and data usage in general.
